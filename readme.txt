Magic Login eliminates the need to know administrator or user credentials. Without disturbing WordPressâ€™s login page. It is a very useful plugin for Developers.

== Description ==

Rather than needing to remember usernames and passwords, a dropdown list will appear in the login form when you want to login.
It adds a combo box of the first 100 users and their roles (administrator, author, editor, subscriber, etc.) in the login form to take you to the dashboard in just one click over the user name.
It allows you to select the user or role you would like to log in as.
